1. MicrosoftAssignment is an application containing grid to display images and wrap it to fix its size to maximum 3 columns.
   It is posssible to scroll vertically downwards and upwards or by using the finger swipe. 

2. To achieve the placeholder, I have used CustomControl and different animiation to have a smooth UI.

3. There was an issue with the folowing URL: http://static.pexels.com/photos/9635/suit-portrait-preparation-wedding.jpg 
   so, I have handled it using ImageUserControl.FailedContent

4. I have placed images in project folder "/Images" and I haven't used any known Location so that application will run without any configuration.

5. Images are displayed in alphabetical order.
